# Python-for-Everyone

This is the GitHub Repository for the Python for Everyone course I am conducting in Springfields Apartments.

Kudos to the Analytics Club, IITM, for their generous help with the Jupyter Notebooks. In fact much of the content here would not be possible without their support and hard work.

If anyone has any problems installing Anaconda, please visit the following links:

[Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) | [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) | [macOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)

And, if anyone has any other issues, please put them up on the Issues Tab present on GitHub. I'll be notified instantly, so I'll be able to help you much better, and what's more is that it will be there for everyone to see in the future as well, so it'll be a community service as well!

Happy learning!
